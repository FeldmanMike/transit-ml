Once you have access to your repository, clone it to your local machine using:

$ git clone [repo url]

You should be able to do this with your own GitHub credentials.

Work flow is as follows.

    Create your own branch (eg 'nathan') if you don't have one.
    $ git branch nathan
    Make sure you are on YourBranch. To switch to your branch:
    $ git checkout <YourBranch>
    $ git pull origin master 
    Work
    $ git add ...
    $ git commit ...
    $ git push origin <YourBranch>
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge <YourBranch>
    $ git push origin master
